# Mixpanel (Simplified)

This is a version of Mixpanel's [iOS SDK](https://github.com/mixpanel/mixpanel-iphone.git) that:

- Is persistent by default
- Has a low memory profile
- Works across processes and in extensions
- Works on iOS 5 and OS X 10.7 and above
- Only tracks events
- Does not use `UIApplication`
